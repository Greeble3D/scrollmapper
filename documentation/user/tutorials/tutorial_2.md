# Scrollmapper - Tutorial 2: Using Scrollmapper with Gephi

Integrating with [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) was a big priority when developing Scrollmapper. We will be adding more integration features as time goes on.

## Gephi Integration

Scrollmapper comes pre-packaged with 340,000 cross-references from [openbible.info](https://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/).

That gives some great big-data analysis potential to the scriptures.
