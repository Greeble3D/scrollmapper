# Scrollmapper - Scripture Analysis Tool

A scripture analysis tool created with Godot 4.

*Presently in prototype phase. Major features are working.*

In **Scrollmapper**, you can:

- Create graphs of connections between scriptures.
- Export built cross-references to [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) for analysis.
- Explore a large database of scripture cross-references.
- Use a general reader.

Search scriptures and assign metadata to them, which can be exported to [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) for detailed analysis.

### Prototype / Beta Version

This is the first basic release of the Scrollmapper tool. We intend to expand its features over time.
