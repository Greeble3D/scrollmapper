# Scrollmapper - Scripture Analysis Tool

A scripture analysis tool created with Godot 4.

*Presently in prototype phase. Major features are working.*

This should work "out of the box" as a Godot 4 project. It should export as a running app without any issues. We will provide the actual package as a download after we have completed and polished the tool as a whole and completed the documentation.

## General Use

This is a graphing software designed to establish cross-references between canonical scriptures and lost books.

In **Scrollmapper**, you can:

- Create graphs of connections between scriptures.
- Export built cross-references to [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) for analysis.
- Share complex scripture mapping graphs between users.
- Share exported CSV cross-references for other users, as well as general spreadsheet-based analysis. 
- Explore a large database of scripture cross-references while reading or working.
- Use a general reader.

## Advanced Use

Search scriptures and assign metadata to them, which can be exported to [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) for detailed analysis.

### Prototype / Beta Version

This is the first basic release of the Scrollmapper tool. We intend to expand its features over time.
