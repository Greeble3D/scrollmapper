## Where to find your actual data files

These files represent the defaults included with the app download. They are generally used for first-install and resets, to be copied to the user data area. The actual data files that the app uses are located in the user-data directories of your operating system. For more details, see the [Godot Engine documentation on data paths](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/io/data_paths.html).
